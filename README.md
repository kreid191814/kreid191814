</p>
I'm a IT professional with a strong passion for solving real-world problems through technology. I specialize in system implementation, automation, and infrastructure support and i'm always exploring new ways to optimize workflows, enhance security and deliver reliable tech solutions.

## CURRENT ROLE
I'm currently leading the technical implementation of a new Electronic Health Record system at a healthcare organization. This includes coordinating across departments, configuring system environments, managing data migration, and ensuring secure, compliant deployment. I'm gaining valuable hands-on experience in health IT, project management and cross functional collaboration.
