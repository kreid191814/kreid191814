I'm a experienced Program Manager and Senior Data Analyst passionate about Health IT. I bridge the gap between healthcare challenges and technology solutions—leading programs, streamlining workflows, and delivering real-world impact through code and coordination. I have previously worked on a project with the Center for Medicaid & Medicare services utilizing AWS Cloud Infrastructure and I'm currently working on a major Electronic Health Record Implementation project with Oracle Health and Indian Health Services called PATH EHR.
